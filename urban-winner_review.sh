chmod x

#Review urban-winner



#When I ran the script I had to exit out of udevadm command, mabey you could create some comments instructing the user

#they may have to do this otherwise it stays on to monitor mode



#Also chmod x is saying it is missing operand after 'x' so I think it is missing some of the argument
